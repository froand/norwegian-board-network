# Norwegian Board & Government Network Explorer

Interactive graph visualization exploring conflicts of interest between Norwegian politicians, board memberships, and government positions. Designed to reveal "revolving door" patterns and potential biases in political decision-making.

## Features

### 🔍 Search
- Search for **any person or company** by name
- Queries both local political dataset and Brønnøysundregistrene (brreg.no) live API
- Click a result to load their full network into the graph

### 🕸️ Interactive Network Graph
- Force-directed graph with zoom, pan, and click-to-expand
- Color-coded nodes: persons (blue), companies (green), parties (pink), government bodies (amber)
- Color-coded links by relationship type (board, political, government, executive)
- Click any node to expand and reveal more connections

### 📅 Timeline / Revolving Door View
- Visual horizontal timeline showing a person's positions over time
- Automatically detects **"svingdør" (revolving door) patterns** — short gaps between leaving government and joining corporate boards
- Highlights potential karantene violations

### ⚠️ Conflict of Interest Alerts
- Auto-detects potential conflicts: sector overlap, concurrent positions, revolving door
- Severity ratings (high/medium/low)
- Filterable by conflict type
- Click any conflict to focus on the person in the graph

### 🔍 Filter Panel
- Toggle node types (persons, companies, parties, government bodies)
- Toggle relationship categories (board, political, government, executive)
- Real-time graph filtering

## Data Sources
- **Brønnøysundregistrene (brreg.no)** — Company roles and board members (live API)
- **Stortinget.no** — Politicians and committees (sample data, live API planned)
- **Regjeringen.no** — Government positions (sample data)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + react-force-graph-2d
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript
- **Data**: brreg.no REST API + in-memory political dataset
