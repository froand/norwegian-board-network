# Norwegian Board & Government Network Explorer

Interactive graph visualization exploring conflicts of interest between Norwegian politicians, board memberships, and government positions. Designed to reveal "revolving door" patterns and potential biases in political decision-making.

## Features

### 🏢 Company Details Panel
- Click any company node to see rich details from Brønnøysundregistrene
- **Key metrics**: employees, founding date, last annual report, ownership sector
- **Industry codes** (næringskoder) showing exact business activities
- **State ownership flag** — highlights when a company is state-owned (relevant for conflict analysis)
- **Publicly listed badge** (ASA companies)
- **Purpose statement** (vedtektsfestet formål)
- **Contact info**: address, website, phone, org number
- **Conflict relevance warning** for state-owned companies

### 👤 Person Details with Position History
- Click any politician to see their **current and past positions**
- Live data from Stortinget.no: committee membership, email, party, fylke
- **Curated past positions** for notable politicians (minister roles, private sector jobs)
- Historical Stortinget periods served (auto-detected from API)
- Photo from Stortinget.no

### 🔍 Search
- Search for **any person or company** by name
- Queries **Stortinget.no** (all representatives), local political dataset, and **brreg.no** live API
- Search replaces the graph view with the person/company's network
- "🏛️ Oversikt" button resets to default Stortinget view

### 🕸️ Interactive 3D Network Graph
- **3D force-directed graph** powered by Three.js — rotate, zoom, and explore in 3D space
- Color-coded nodes: persons (blue), companies (green), parties (pink), government bodies (amber)
- Animated directional particles on links showing relationship flow
- Color-coded links by relationship type (board, political, government, executive)
- Click any node to expand and reveal more connections
- Click a party node to load all its Stortinget representatives
- Camera auto-focuses on selected nodes

### 📅 Timeline / Revolving Door View
- Visual horizontal timeline showing a person's positions over time
- Automatically detects **"svingdør" (revolving door) patterns** — short gaps between leaving government and joining corporate boards
- Highlights potential karantene violations

### ⚠️ Conflict of Interest Alerts (draggable panel)
- Auto-detects potential conflicts: sector overlap, concurrent positions, revolving door
- Severity ratings (high/medium/low)
- Filterable by conflict type
- Click any conflict to focus on the person in the graph
- **Draggable** — move the panel anywhere on screen

### 🔍 Filter Panel (draggable)
- Toggle node types (persons, companies, parties, government bodies)
- Toggle relationship categories (board, political, government, executive)
- Real-time graph filtering
- **Draggable** — won't block other panels

### 🎨 Stortinget-inspired Design
- Red accent bar, serif headings (Merriweather), clean light panels
- Dark navy 3D graph background for contrast
- Responsive layout matching stortinget.no aesthetics

## Data Sources (all live APIs, no static data)

## SEO

Search-engine optimization for `https://www.norsknettverk.com` is built into the
frontend (a Vite SPA served statically by `serve`).

- **Single source of truth**: `frontend/src/seo/siteConfig.ts` (domain, titles,
  descriptions, Open Graph, locales). Import from here — never hardcode the domain.
- **Static `<head>`** (`frontend/index.html`): unique `<title>`, meta description,
  `<link rel="canonical">`, robots, Open Graph + Twitter cards, and JSON-LD
  (`WebSite` + `Organization` + `WebApplication`). A `<noscript>` block provides
  crawlable content for engines that don't run JavaScript.
- **Build-time injection**: `vite.config.ts` replaces `__SITE_URL__` and
  `__ROBOTS__` tokens from `VITE_SITE_URL` / `VITE_ALLOW_INDEXING`, so the correct
  domain and index/noindex directive ship in the HTML.
- **Runtime**: `frontend/src/seo/applySeo.ts` keeps `<html lang>`, title,
  description and `og:locale` in sync with the NO/EN language toggle.
- **`robots.txt`** and **`sitemap.xml`**: `frontend/public/` (served at the site root).
- **Social image**: `frontend/public/og-image.svg` (1200×630).

### Environment variables (Vite build-time)

| Variable | Production | Preview/staging |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SITE_URL` | `https://www.norsknettverk.com` | preview URL |
| `VITE_ALLOW_INDEXING` | `true` | `false` (emits `noindex, nofollow`) |

### SEO tests

`frontend/scripts/seo-check.mjs` validates the built `dist/` (title, description,
canonical/robots/OG/JSON-LD, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`). Run locally with
`npm run seo:verify` (build + check). It also runs in CI via
`.github/workflows/seo-check.yml` on every push and pull request.

### Manual / hosting steps (outside the codebase)

- **apex → www redirect**: `serve` cannot do host-based redirects. Configure a
  permanent (301) redirect from `norsknettverk.com` to `www.norsknettverk.com` at
  the edge (Azure Container Apps custom domain + Front Door, or your DNS/CDN).
  HTTP → HTTPS is already enforced by Container Apps ingress (`allowInsecure: false`).
- **Google Search Console**: add a Domain property for `norsknettverk.com`, verify
  via DNS TXT, submit `https://www.norsknettverk.com/sitemap.xml`, and request
  indexing of the homepage.
